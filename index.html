        <p> SFDC is a website where mobile and web apps are designed.  I caught interest in this website
          because of the animated background and the animated affects that appear on the title screen.
          I also took interest wondering how the page is able to transition when you scroll down from the title page. </p>

          </a>
          <p> What I liked about this website is the animation it shows in the background.  The graphics are simple
          in the foreground and are given an interesting layout.  What caught my interest the most was on the loading
        page, the cursor was different and the page changed after the loading page finished. </p>

        <p> Van Acker is a Swedish webpage showing different types of decor.  The enter page has a nice design and clean
        layout.  What I liked was how it had a slideshow for images shown on the homepage. </p>
