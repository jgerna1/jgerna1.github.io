            <img src="images/sites/site1.png" alt="Screenshot of SFCD">
          </a>
        <p> SFDC is a website where mobile and web apps are designed.  I caught interest in this website
          because of the animated background and the animated affects that appear on the title screen.
          I also took interest wondering how the page is able to transition when you scroll down from the title page.

            <img src="images/sites/site2.png" alt="Screenshot of Johos.at">
          </a>
          <p> What I liked about this website is the animation it shows in the background.  The graphics are simple
          in the foreground and are given an interesting layout.  What caught my interest the most was on the loading
        page, the cursor was different and the page changed after the loading page finished. </p>

          <img src="images/sites/site3.png" alt="Screenshot of VanAcker">
        </a>
        <p> Van Acker is a Swedish webpage showing different types of decor.  The enter page has a nice design and clean
        layout.  What I liked was how it had a slideshow for images shown on the homepage. </p>

          <img src="images/sites/site4.png" alt="Screenshot of Opera Philadelphia">
        </a>
        <p> Opera Philadelphia is a website for opera showings in Philadelphia city.  I thought the graphics for this website were
          very interesting in the sense that their colors and animations were unique.  The way some of the graphics move as you
          move your cursor or scroll down the page is very interesting as well. </p>

      <li>
        <a href="http://leonbara.com">
          <img src="images/sites/site5.png" alt="Screenshot of Leon Bara">
        </a>
        <p> Leon Bara is a designer brand.  This website was very interesting where the page is one long webpage to scroll down.
            The right of the page has the number of pages which I'd like to see how it was coded since it allows quick access to
              page number you've clicked.  The page also has transitioning colors and images for the background as you scroll down
              the page. </p>

          <img src="images/sites/site6.png" alt="Screenshot of Bernard Tschumi Architects">
        </a>
          <p> Bernard Tschumi Architects is a website showing the architects  they've made located in China.  What I found interesting
            was the slideshow in the middle of the web page.  How it transitioned seemed pretty neat which made up for the background
            being very basic.  I wanted to see how this slideshow is coded via CSS or Javascript. </p>

        <a href="http://www.kejjo.com">
          <img src="images/sites/site7.png" alt="Screenshot of Kejjo">
        </a>
          <p> Kejjo is a studio developing different web design projects.  What caught my attention about this website is how the page
            scrolls onto another layer while the background at the top of the page becomes hidden.  When scrolling down, the white half
            of the page below will cover the upper half of the page which was interesting. </p>

        <img src="images/sites/site8.png" alt="Screenshot of Proud Creative">
      </a>
        <p> Proud Creative is a studio focusing on visual storytelling and animation for different business fields.  What I thought was
          interesting about this website was the way the layout was set up.  It is a bunch of different slides put into one main page.
          Another interesting thing is how each slide had its own animation or text. </p>

        <a href="http://www.studiovonbirken.com">
        <img src="images/sites/site9.png" alt="Screenshot of Studio von Birken">
      </a>
        <p> Studio von Birken is a fashion website showing different model images and clothing.  While the site isn't much, I found
          layout to be interesting. The way the images and text are set up in an organized fashion is neat. </p>

        <a href="http://www.index-std.com">
        <img src="images/sites/site10.png" alt="Screenshot of Index-STD">
      </a>
        <p> Index-STD is a website displaying different texts that link to other webpages.  The way how the text is demonstrated very
          interesting and unique.  It looks like an eye exam text board and while scrolling, the text at the top while the bottom is tiny.
          It would be interesting to know how this was coded. </p>

        <img src="images/sites/site11.png" alt="Screenshot of Commission">
      </a>
        <p> Commission is another webpage working on creating designs for web pages.  The way the page transitions between other pages
          page is interesting.  The way the page slides up and left or right when clicking the other navigation links in the page. </p>

        <a href="http://www.mynameis.fr/#menu">

      </a>
        <p> My name is is a french website for graphic design and art.  When entering this page, it has a little introduction showing
          the different graphic animations with the "My name is" title.  When scrolling down the page, the "My name is" scrolls with
          the page matching up with the names listed below the page. </p>

        <a href="http://www.tankboys.biz">
        <img src="images/sites/site13.png" alt="Screenshot of tankboys">
      </a>
        <p> Tankboys is a website about studio website for pre-ordering.  The thing that caught my attention about this website is the
          3D book animated in the center of the screen.  The way it rotates is either a .gif file or a javascripted animation of a 3D shape.
          It would be interesting to learn how to do this. </p>

      </a>
        <p> Zut Alors Iinc. is typeface website displaying different paragraphs of texts and images.  What I liked about this website was
          the way it transitions while scrolling down.  Each page scrolling down was it's own full page.  The other thing I liked was how
          the cursor is different on the main page. </p>

      </a>
        <p> SquareSpace is a website that allows you to create a website with a subscription or free trial.  The main page is what I found
          interesting about the website where there is a video playing in the center.  I want to know how you can display text above the video
          playing.  The underlining of the navigation links is neat looking too when hovering your cursor over the link. <p>
